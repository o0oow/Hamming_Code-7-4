Run the executable file main from the current directory. If you're not in the current directory, provide the full path to the file.

g++ -shared -o Mylib.dll lib.cpp
This command creates a dynamic library named Mylib.dll from the source file lib.cpp. Run this command each time you make changes to lib.cpp to update the library.

g++ main.cpp -L. -lMylib -o main
This compiles main.cpp and links it with the dynamic library Mylib.dll located in the current directory (-L.) to produce the executable main.

g++ -c lib.cpp -o lib.o
This compiles lib.cpp into an object file named lib.o without linking.

ar rcs libMylib.a lib.o
This initializes a static library named libMylib.a using the object file lib.o. The ar tool packages the object file into a static library format.

g++ main.cpp -L. -lMylib -o main
This command compiles main.cpp and links it with the static library libMylib.a located in the current directory (-L.) to produce the executable main.
